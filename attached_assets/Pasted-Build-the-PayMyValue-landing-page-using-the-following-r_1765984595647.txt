WHAT IS DIMINISHED VALUE? (SEO SECTION)
Text:
“When your car has an accident, even after quality repairs, buyers will not pay the same price they would have before the crash. The difference in resale value is diminished value. Insurers are required to compensate you for this loss when you are not at fault. Our IACP-certified diminished value appraisal calculates your vehicle’s true loss in value and prepares everything you need to claim it.”

HOW IT WORKS

Text: “Enter your vehicle and accident details to confirm you qualify.”

Step 2: Generate your certified appraisal
Text: “Instantly receive your full appraisal package, including a demand letter and state-specific legal references.”

Step 3: Negotiate with confidence
Text: “Upload insurer messages and get guided counter-responses until your diminished value check is paid.”
