I already have a PayMyValue app generated in this Replit.
Update the landing page so the main call-to-action is a free AI pre-qualification estimate before the paid appraisal.

Requirements:

Hero section

Keep the PayMyValue branding and current layout, but change the copy so it leads with the free estimate.

Headline: “See Your Car’s Lost Value In Seconds”

Subheadline: “Check if you’re pre-qualified for a diminished value payout with a free AI-powered estimate. Then upgrade to a certified appraisal and demand letter in minutes, not days.”

Primary button (bright): “Get My Free Estimate (30 seconds)”

Secondary button (outline): “Start Full Appraisal ($299)”

Small line under the buttons: “Average diminished value check: $3,400 • Specialized in GA, FL, NC”.

Free pre-qualification flow

When the user clicks “Get My Free Estimate”, open a slide-in panel or modal on the right side with a short form.

Form fields:

Year (number)

Make (text)

Model (text)

Current mileage (number)

Number of previous reported accidents (0, 1, 2+)

State (GA, FL, NC dropdown)

On submit, do not create a full case. Instead, run a simple function that returns a generic diminished value range (for now you can hard-code a simple formula based on year, mileage, and accidents).

Show a result screen inside the panel with text like:

“Based on your answers, your estimated diminished value range is: $X – $Y.”

Make the range visually prominent in a card.

Add a small disclaimer: “This is an informational estimate only, not a certified appraisal.”

Upsell to paid appraisal

Under the range, add a bold CTA button:

“Generate My Certified Appraisal & Demand Letter ($299)”

When clicked, route the user into the existing signup / login + full appraisal flow (or to a placeholder “Full Appraisal Coming Soon” page if payment is not implemented yet).

Visual style

Use a dark, futuristic gradient in the hero and pre-qual panel so it feels like cutting-edge AI technology.

Use a glassmorphism style card for the estimate result (semi-transparent dark background, subtle border, and glow).

Make sure this integrates cleanly with the existing Tailwind/React setup and doesn’t break the rest of the app.

Please:

Create any new React components you need (e.g., PrequalForm), wire them into the existing landing page, and update routes as needed.

Keep the code well-commented so I can easily see where to adjust the estimate formula and the upgrade CTA behavior later.
