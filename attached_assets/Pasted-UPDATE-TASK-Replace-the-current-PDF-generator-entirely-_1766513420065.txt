UPDATE TASK:
Replace the current PDF generator entirely. Do not patch it — rewrite it using a professional-grade PDF engine.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Use the `pdf-lib` library for building the DV appraisal PDF.
2. Support SVG import for:
   • Vehicle diagrams (top, front, side, rear views)
   • Section icons (repair wrench, document icon, car icon)
   • Styled section headers with red underline (matching SAA visuals)
3. Support PNG/JPEG embedding for:
   • Charts (valuation high vs low)
   • Damage point overlays
   • Branding/logo assets

FILE: /src/server/services/appraisalPdfService.ts
Replace all logic with a new template-driven generator.

STRUCTURE:
The PDF must include 10 pages that mimic the structure and visual polish of the Select Auto Appraisals report:

PAGE 1 – COVER  
PAGE 2 – OWNER / VEHICLE / INSURANCE  
PAGE 3 – PURPOSE OF REPORT + GEORGIA LAW + CASE LAW  
PAGE 4 – REPAIR CENTER + DAMAGE DIAGRAM (4-view SVG overlay)  
PAGE 5 – THIRD-PARTY VALUATION + HIGH/LOW CHART  
PAGE 6 – COMPARABLES TABLE (3 nationwide comps required)  
PAGE 7 – DIRECTIVE 08-P&C-2 SUMMARY  
PAGE 8 – RESULTS OF EVALUATION (Long narrative)  
PAGE 9 – DV CALCULATION TABLE  
PAGE 10 – CERTIFICATION PAGE

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
• Use a grid and column system similar to SAA.
• Use consistent typography (Inter or Helvetica).
• Headers: 16–22pt bold.
• Body text: 9–11pt.
• Section red underline stroke: 2px thick #cc0000.
• Logos and icons must be aligned as in the reference PDF.
• Table borders must be light grey (#dddddd).
• Page footers must include:
  “Georgia Diminished Value Appraisal Report – [Owner Name] – Page X of 10”

DAMAGE DIAGRAM:
• Import multi-view vehicle SVGs stored in /assets/vehicle/.
• Overlay red circles based on keyImpactAreas[] mapped coordinates.
• Each circle = 12px diameter, #cc0000 fill with 60% opacity.

CHART GENERATION:
Use chart.js or quickchart.io to generate a simple bar chart:
• Clean Retail vs Rough Retail comparison
• Embed chart as PNG into Page 5.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT generate text-based PDFs anymore.  
All pages must be visually laid out using positioned elements.

Implement the new PDF generator as described.
