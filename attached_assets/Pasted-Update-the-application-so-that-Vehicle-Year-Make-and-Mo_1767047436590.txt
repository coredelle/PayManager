Update the application so that Vehicle Year, Make, and Model follow a strict best-practice cascading dropdown flow everywhere they appear in the app (intake, edit, review, valuation).

Order of selection must be:

Year

Make

Model

Free-text inputs for these fields should be completely removed.

Frontend (React + TypeScript)
Year Dropdown

Replace the Year text input with a dropdown selector.

Year options must range from 1900 through the current calendar year.

The list should be generated dynamically (not hardcoded).

Default state: unselected.

Year selection is required before Make is enabled.

Make Dropdown

Replace all Make text inputs with a dropdown.

Make dropdown should:

Be disabled until a Year is selected

Load all available vehicle manufacturers from the backend

Reset if Year changes

No free-text entry allowed.

Model Dropdown

Replace all Model text inputs with a dropdown.

Model dropdown should:

Be disabled until both Year and Make are selected

Dynamically populate based on selected Year + Make

Reset if either Year or Make changes

Display a loading state while fetching models.

Gracefully handle cases where no models are returned.

Backend (Express API)

Create or update the following endpoints:

GET /api/vehicles/makes?year={year}

GET /api/vehicles/models?year={year}&make={make}

Data source requirements:

Use the MarketCheck API as the source of truth.

Do not hardcode makes or models.

Normalize responses so Make and Model names exactly match MarketCheck naming conventions.

Caching

Cache Year → Make and Year + Make → Model responses server-side.

Cache TTL: 24 hours.

Avoid repeated external API calls for the same selections.

UX + Validation Rules

Prevent form submission unless:

Year is selected

Make is selected

Model is selected

Maintain existing styling (Tailwind + shadcn/ui).

Show clear disabled states for dependent dropdowns.

Reset dependent selections automatically when an upstream value changes.

Global Consistency Requirement

This Year → Make → Model dropdown flow must be used everywhere in the app where vehicle details appear.

Do not mix dropdowns and text inputs in different screens.

Ensure stored values are consistent across:

Valuation logic

Comparable searches

Appraisal PDF generation

Demand letters

Explicit Constraints

Do NOT use free-text inputs for Year, Make, or Model.

Do NOT allow users to type arbitrary values.

Do NOT maintain a custom vehicle database.

Do NOT partially implement this on only one screen.
